            Haridra Nadhi is a temple tank located at Mannargudi and it's the only pond which is denoted as river (Nadhi) in Tamil Nadu. It is the largest temple pond in India and hence it is the reason behind the name - Haridhra Nadhi. This pond is filled with water from two reservoirs, where one from Pamani River is poured manually with electric motors and the natural reservoir is through canal from Vaduvur Lake.
