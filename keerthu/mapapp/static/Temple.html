            Sri Rajagopalaswamy Temple is dedicated to Rajagopalaswamy, an incarnation of Lord Krishna. The temple was first constructed by Kulothunga Chola I. Successive kings of the Chola Empire, Rajaraja Chola III, Rajendra Chola III and kings of Thanjavur Nayaks, Achyuta Devaraya expanded the temple. The temple contains inscriptions of the Hoysala kings and some Vijayanagara grants and many records of the later Nayaks and Marathas. The Thanjavur Nayaks made the temple as their dynastic and primary shrine and made significant additions.
